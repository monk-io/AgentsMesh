# AgentsMesh Runner — dev image
#
# This image is the AI CLI overlay on top of the bazel-built runner
# binary. The binary itself is produced by `bazel build
# //runner/cmd/runner:runner` (cross-compiled to linux/amd64 by
# dev.sh on macOS hosts) and copied in via the build context. There's
# no Go toolchain or `air` inside the image — the binary is the unit
# of deployment, same compile path as CI / production.
#
# Hot reload is intentionally off: the runner spawns AI agent
# processes that need a sandbox boundary, so we trade rebuild speed
# for isolation. To rebuild after a runner code change:
#   ./dev.sh --rebuild-runner
FROM debian:trixie-slim

# Base packages + AI CLI dependencies (Node 20+ for Gemini CLI).
