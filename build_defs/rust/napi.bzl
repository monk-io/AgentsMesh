"""Rust → Node-API (.node) native addon.

Compiles a Rust crate as a `cdylib` and renames the platform-specific
dynamic library (`lib<name>.dylib` / `lib<name>.so` / `<name>.dll`) into
the Node-friendly `<name>.node` suffix that `require()` expects.

Usage:
    load("//build_defs/rust:napi.bzl", "napi_rust_library")

    napi_rust_library(
        name = "node_bridge",
        crate = "//clients/core/crates/node-bridge:node_bridge_lib",
        visibility = ["//clients/desktop:__subpackages__"],
    )

The macro does not attempt to run `@napi-rs/cli`. The Rust `build.rs`
still emits the N-API header bindings; we ship the compiled `.node`
alongside it. TypeScript declarations are expected to be hand-maintained
(or generated separately via `js_run_binary` wrapping `napi build --dts`).

Known limits:
  - Node's N-API ABI must match the Electron build being shipped. Pin
    the target `node_version` in `MODULE.bazel` to match the Electron
    release's node ABI.
  - Cross-compilation is handled by `--platforms` (e.g. `linux/amd64`
    vs `darwin/arm64`); this macro simply packages whatever slice the
    current configuration produces.

Linker note:
  N-API symbols (`napi_*`, `_napi_wrap`, etc.) are resolved by the
  hosting Node/Electron process at `require()` time, not at link
  time of the addon itself. The default rustc cdylib link line on
  macOS errors with `Undefined symbols: _napi_wrap` because nothing
  on disk defines them. We pass `-undefined dynamic_lookup` (macOS)
  or `--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all` (linux) so the cdylib links
  with those symbols deliberately unresolved, deferring binding to
  the runtime loader. Mirrors what `@napi-rs/cli` does on the
  outside.

    The output is named `<binary_name>.<platform-triple>.node` (e.g.

    `index.js` loader (which `require()`s a fixed per-platform filename)
    can pick it up unchanged. If `binary_name` is omitted the output
    falls back to plain `<name>.node`.

    Args:
        name: Bazel target name (becomes the filegroup label).
        srcs: Rust source files for the crate.
        deps: Rust library dependencies.
        proc_macro_deps: Rust proc-macro deps (e.g. napi-derive).
        crate_name: Override for the emitted crate name. Defaults to `name`.
        edition: Rust edition. Defaults to 2021.
        ts_declaration: Optional label pointing at a hand-written `.d.ts`
            file to copy next to the `.node`. If absent, the package
            exports the addon only.
        binary_name: Filename stem to emit (e.g. `agentsmesh-node-bridge`).
