// Facade re-export of the channel Connect-RPC adapter. Business code imports
// from here (or from the `@/lib/api` barrel) so the wire-shape layer stays
// internal to the facade boundary. Tests mock this path.
//
// The wire layer was split into 3 SRP-aligned files (CRUD / messages /
// members) — this facade unifies them so callers see one surface.
